description: Develop BokehJS as a first-class JavaScript library
---
By and large none of the core contributors have been JS or front-end experts, and for some time the client side BokehJS library was an implementation detail.
There is more interest to use BokehJS directly, and with attention from experienced front-end JS developers, BokehJS could integrate better with existing common web frameworks and tools than it currently does.
This includes making much more accessible documentation for BokehJS itself.
These improvements would also help increase the potential pool of core developers interested in maintaining BokehJS over the long run.
