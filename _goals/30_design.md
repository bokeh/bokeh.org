Bokeh has never had the benefit of any dedicated web or visual designers, and this is one area where it suffers compared to some other projects.
Visually, it looks much less “designed by engineers” than it used to, there is still much room for improvement. Another idea, if *Better Theming Support* is accomplished is to have visual designers help create a set of attractive themes that can be immediately available to users.
