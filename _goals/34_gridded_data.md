description: Improve Handling of Gridded Data
---
Bokeh is already equipped to process timeseries and image-like data, for example
from microscopy or electrophysiological experiments. However, in oder to become
a more useful tool for these applications, handling of high-volume, gridded
data in Bokeh requires improvements in terms of performance, stability, and
usability.
