description: Improve Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion among contributors and users
---
We have repeatedly experienced that diversity, resulting from an inclusive
culture, is intrinsically good for the project and a crucial factor in making
Bokeh a better tool. Making Bokeh welcoming and supportive to everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation, is a continual process of
learning and improvement.
