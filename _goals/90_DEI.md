description: Improve Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion among Contributors and Users
---
We have repeatedly experienced that diversity, resulting from an inclusive
culture, is intrinsically good for the project and a crucial factor in making
Bokeh a better tool. We are determined to make Bokeh welcoming and supportive to
users and contributors, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We are aware
that working towards this goal is a continual process of learning and
improvement.
