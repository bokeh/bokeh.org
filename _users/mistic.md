[Mistic ](https://github.com/MathOnco/Mistic) is a software package written in Python and uses the visualization library Bokeh.

Mistic can be used to simultaneously view multiple multiplexed 2D images using pre-defined coordinates (e.g. t-SNE or UMAP), randomly generated coordinates, or as vertical grids to provide an overall visual preview of the entire multiplexed image dataset.
