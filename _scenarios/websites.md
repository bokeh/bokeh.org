Maybe you've created a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web app that needs to include reporting charts.
Or maybe you've written an article for a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog that needs some infographics to illustrate your point.

Bokeh offers a variety of methods to embed its content in web pages: [`server_document`](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#app-documents) for deployed Bokeh server applications, or [`json_items`](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#json-items) and [`components`](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#components) for standalone Bokeh output.
