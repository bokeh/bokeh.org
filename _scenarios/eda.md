Bokeh works in both [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as well as [classic notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

Sophisticated interactive visualizations to use alongside your notebook explorations are only a call to `output_notebook` away&mdash;and that includes full embedded Bokeh server applications.

Try things out right now with the [live tutorial notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/tutorial/main?filepath=notebooks%2F01_introduction.ipynb) hosted generously by [MyBinder](https://gke.mybinder.org/).
